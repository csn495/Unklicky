This is a slight modification to the BFP-HS probe that moves the M3x16 screw to the rear of the probe body instead of the front. I found that this can be beneficial in that it allows for the Z-Probe to interface with the bottom of the probe body without crashing into the bed. Pressing the Z-Probe against the UnKlicky body further towards the center of mass decreases the probability of any wiggle happening compared to having to press against the probe body closer to the edge, especially when using Z-Probes with stronger actuation force.
